# ArchivesSpace User Guide

{: .note }
> This page is under construction! 
> Additional content coming soon ...

Internal Documentation is currently available in the [ArchivesSpace User Guide 🔒](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VRYbYRTR_ynE1_H6LXVeIwYP4l9AfcNiK5KMD_I4gdw/edit?usp=sharing). 

This User Guide was created by Archival Processing and is intended to be used by all NYPL ArchivesSpace users. This documentation should be consulted in conjunction with the [Archival Processing manual](https://nypl.github.io/archival-processing/processing-manual/), which details standards and workflows for archival description that is created in ArchivesSpace. 

The ArchivesSpace staff instance is managed by [Archival Processing 🔒](https://sites.google.com/nypl.org/specialcollections/special-collections-processing/archival-processing) management.

NYPL’s instance of ArchivesSpace is hosted by [Lyrasis](https://lyrasis.org/archivesspace-hosting/), an organization that specializes in hosting and supporting ASpace. Lyrasis assures that our ASpace instance is running correctly, and also assists with upgrades, customizations, and plugin maintenance. All communications with Lyrasis are initiated and managed by Archival Processing and Collections Access and Discovery

NYPL is currently using a highly customized instance of ArchivesSpace 2.5, but actively testing features in version 4.1, which is the most current version of ASpace. This guide is written for use with ArchivesSpace 2.5 and all of its local customizations. We also recommend consulting ArchivesSpace’s own [User Manual](https://archivesspace.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ArchivesSpaceUserManual/pages/909934631/ArchivesSpace+User+Manual) and [training videos](https://www.youtube.com/@archivesspace5340), which are created, managed, and maintained by the [ArchivesSpace Community](https://archivesspace.org/). 

All ArchivesSpace users should register for the [ArchivesSpace Help Center](https://archivesspace.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ArchivesSpaceUserManual/overview), which provides additional resources and insight from the ASpace community. The Help Center is available to all ASpace users at ASpace member institutions.
