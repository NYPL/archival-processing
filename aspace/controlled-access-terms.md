# Controlled Access Terms
{: .no_toc }

After creating the front-matter description for the collection, add controlled access terms. Controlled access terms include agents (personal names, corporate names, family names) and subjects (topics, form/genre, occupations). This section will detail how to create those terms. See the Archival Process Manual section on [controlled access terms](https://nypl.github.io/archival-processing/processing-manual/archival-description/controlled-access-terms/) for additional information. 

## Table of Contents

## Agent Links
The _Agent Links_ form allows for name terms to be associated with collections. Name sub-forms can be added by clicking the _Add Agent Link_ button, or the + bar at the bottom of the form (button 1). Each sub-form should contain exactly one name link.

When adding an agent link, select the agent role from the _Role_ menu (field 2). Use the following rules when selecting Roles:

### Main Entry
Select _Main Entry_ ([MARC 1xx](https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/bd1xx.html)) if the agent is primarily responsible for the creation, assembly, accumulation, and/or maintenance and use of the materials being described. Generally, each collection should have exactly one _Main Entry_, although exceptions may arise for artificial collections when a main entry should not be used. See the [Archival Processing Manual](https://nypl.github.io/archival-processing/processing-manual/archival-description/controlled-access-terms/#main-entry) for more information on working with artificial collections.

### Creator/Contributor
Select _Creator/Contributor_ ([MARC 7xx](https://www.loc.gov/marc/authority/ad7xx.html)) if the agent created material in the collection, or contributed to its creation. You must also provide a _Relator_ term (field 3) that describes the _creator/contributor_ relationship with the collection’s main entry. Choose the term from the Library of Congress [MARC Code List for Relators ](https://www.loc.gov/marc/relators/relaterm.html) list. The most commonly used relator term is _contributor_. 

## Subject
Select Subject ([MARC 6xx](https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/bd6xx.html)) if the agent is the subject of the collection, but is not represented materially in it. For example, correspondence about a person that is not by or to them would have that person as a _Subject_.

## Subject Terms/Subdivisions
When supplying an Agent Link with the role of _Subject_, you will have the option to provide subdivisions under the _Terms/Subdivisions_ form. Use this form to provide subdivisions to names used as subjects (e.g. Columbia University -- Students).If an agent is represented by multiple roles in a collection (e.g. the main entry is also the subject of the collection), provide one agent link per role. Do not provide a secondary _Creator/Contributor_ agent link for the _Main Entry_.
