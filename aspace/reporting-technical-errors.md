If you encounter any technical errors with ArchiveSpace’s functionality such as slowness or error messages, you should file a [ServiceNow 🔒](https://nyplprod.service-now.com/nyplsp) ticket. Navigate the _Report Software Incident_ section and select _ArchivesSpace_ in the dropdown menu. All tickets are received and addressed by Archival Processing management. 

We recommend attaching screenshots of errors you encounter to assist in explaining the steps you took before encountering the error. In most cases, issues will be addressed and resolved locally. However, if a larger system issue is encountered, Archival Processing management will contact Lyrasis. In all cases, you will be kept up to date on the status of your ticket.
