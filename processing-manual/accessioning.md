# Accessioning
Accessioning[^1] a new acquisition establishes institutional stewardship of the materials, and facilitates the eventual arrangement and description undertaken by the processing archivist.[^2] At NYPL, accessioning is managed by Collection Mangement. Their team manages the documentation for each new acquisition record in [SPEC](https://nypl.github.io/pres-docs/spec/spec.html), and ensures the accuracy of the metadata associated with its record. These initial steps are crucial to preserve the order and integrity of incoming materials, and serves as the preliminary step in making a new acquisition accessible to future researchers.

At the New York Public Library, this process occurs after a deed of gift or purchase agreement for a new acquisition has been signed by the donor/seller, curator, and NYPL administrators; shipping arrangements have been made by Collection Management, and the collection has been scheduled for delivery. Prior to the delivery date, collection documentation from the acquisition process is compiled by the curator and teams in Collections and Research Services. This documentation includes relevant correspondence, purchase agreements, deed of gift, site visit reports, collection photographs, invoices, and donor/seller inventories.

A SPEC acquisition record is created by the curator and refined during the acquisition process. This record includes an object inventory, expected extent, information on the types of materials expected, and indicates whether the acquisition is an addition to an existing collection. All compiled documentation is stored in an acquisition folder in Google Drive, which is linked to the acquisition record in SPEC.

When a new acquisition is received by the Library, Collection Management works to obtain physical, intellectual, and legal control of the incoming collection materials. Collection Management rehouses materials that are in damaged or in oversized boxes, inventories audio and moving items, separates electronic records, and shelves the new collection in the stacks. 

The LSC Collection Manager notifies Archival Processing management once a new acquisition is accessioned. Archival Processing management links the SPEC acquisition record to a SPEC collection record, creates an ArchivesSpace resource record, and creates project records in the Archival Processing projects queue. The Senior Manager of Archival Processing assigns each new acquisition to a processing archivist based on curatorial priorities, and creates a new card in the [Archival Processing Projects 🔒](https://trello.com/b/9kziJyKg/archival-processing-projects) Trello.

For a detailed workflow of acquisitions and receiving, see Collection Management’s [Intake and Accessioning Procedures 🔒](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ig6HPWLEzDB7zBWARD_t7c3GXOZxJ3_St6Roreab30g/edit?usp=sharing) and [Resources Policies and Procedures 🔒](https://sites.google.com/nypl.org/specialcollections/collection-management/resources/policies-procedures) documentation.
