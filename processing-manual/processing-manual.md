# Processing Manual
The Archival Processing Manual was written as a guide for archivists at the New York Public Library to arrange, describe, preserve, and provide access to collections across all research divisions of the Library. The tasks, procedures, and information described in this manual are intended to provide archivists with the tools, knowledge, and resources necessary to effectively process all archival collections received in the Special Collections Processing department of the New York Public Library.
