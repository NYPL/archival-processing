Welcome to the Archival Processing documentation site of the New York Public Library.

This documentation was written to serve as a guide for archivists on the New York Public Library’s Archival Processing team, a division of the Special Collections Processing department, to arrange, describe, preserve, and provide access to collections across all research divisions of the library. 

This documentation includes the [Archival Processing Manual](../archival-processing/processing-manual) and [ArchivessSpace User Guide](../archival-processing/aspace).
